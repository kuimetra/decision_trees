## About the Project

This project presents an implementation of a decision tree-based classifier from scratch. The classifier is equipped with features such as entropy and Gini index for impurity measurement and supports reduced-error pruning to combat overfitting. The implementation was evaluated using a wine dataset, and its performance was compared to the `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn, giving an idea of its accuracy and efficiency.

## Required Libraries
Install the following Python libraries before running the notebook:

- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas
- numpy

Use the following command to install all required libraries at once:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
```

## How to Run
To run the project, open and execute the 'main.ipynb' Jupyter notebook in sequence.

## Report File

The project includes a report file that provides detailed explanations of each step involved in the implementation, evaluation, and comparison of the decision tree classifier. The report is enriched with visualizations to offer a clearer understanding of the classifier and the concepts behind it.
